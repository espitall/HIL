HIL (say Achille) is a 3D printed humanoid robot project. More informations are available on the website.


How HIL is designed ?

The body has been generated by the [MakeHuman](http://www.makehuman.org) software. Then I use blender to split the whole model into small parts. Finally most of the work is done on [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org).
